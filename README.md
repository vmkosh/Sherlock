# Sherlock
Godot project based on DOS classics game Sherlock

Trying to delve into Python-like But Not Actual Python GodotScript I decided to recreate old DOS game named Sherlock. A game of pure logic and elimination of impossible.
Since I'm doing it whenever I have free time AND will to do it, it'll probably will never be finished. But it's fun to fiddle with Godot and seeing results first-hand.
